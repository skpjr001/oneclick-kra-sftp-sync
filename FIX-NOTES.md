# Log Redirection Fix - Technical Notes

## Problem Description

The original GUI implementation had a critical bug where log output would continue to appear in the terminal after stopping the sync operation. This occurred because:

1. **Improper log redirection cleanup**: The log output wasn't being properly restored to the original destination when the sync was stopped
2. **Background goroutines continuing**: Some sync processes (like directory scanning) continued running in the background even after cancellation
3. **SFTP connection cleanup errors**: Error messages from abrupt connection closures were still being logged to terminal

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Log Redirection Issue
The original implementation used `io.Pipe()` to redirect log output, but the cleanup wasn't properly synchronized:
- Log output was redirected to the GUI using `log.SetOutput(pw)`
- When stopping, the pipe was closed but the original output wasn't immediately restored
- Background goroutines were still writing to the log, causing output to appear in terminal

### 2. Context Cancellation Not Respected
The sync process didn't properly respect context cancellation:
- `buildDirectoryGraph()` had a background progress reporter that didn't check for cancellation
- The sync operation continued even after stop was requested
- SFTP connections remained open, causing connection errors when finally closed

### 3. Error Message Leakage
After cancellation, error messages from closing SFTP connections were still being logged to the terminal because the log output restoration happened after these errors occurred.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom LogWriter Implementation
```go
type LogWriter struct {
    webGui *WebGUI
}

func (lw *LogWriter) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    msg := string(p)
    msg = strings.TrimSpace(msg)

    // Filter out error messages that happen after cancellation
    if lw.webGui.cancelled {
        if strings.Contains(msg, "connection lost") ||
           strings.Contains(msg, "failed to read directory") ||
           strings.Contains(msg, "Error scanning") {
            // Suppress these error messages after cancellation
            return len(p), nil
        }
    }

    if msg != "" {
        lw.webGui.AddLog(msg)
    }

    return len(p), nil
}
```

### 2. Context-Aware Sync Functions
Added context cancellation support to all sync operations:
- `SyncWithContext()` - Main sync function that respects context
- `buildDirectoryGraphWithContext()` - Directory scanning with cancellation checks
- `syncFilesWithContext()` - File transfer with cancellation support

### 3. Improved Process Management
Enhanced the sync process lifecycle:
```go
type SyncProcess struct {
    syncer     *SFTPSync
    cancel     context.CancelFunc
    logRestore func()
    cancelled  bool
}
```

### 4. Proper Cleanup Order
Ensured cleanup happens in the correct order:
1. Cancel sync context
2. Wait for sync goroutines to finish (with timeout)
3. Clean up log redirection
4. Restore original log output
5. Mark process as not running

## Key Changes Made

### webgui.go
- Added `LogWriter` type for direct log capture
- Implemented cancellation-aware log filtering
- Added proper sync process lifecycle management
- Removed pipe-based log redirection in favor of direct writer

### main.go
- Added `SyncWithContext()` function
- Made `buildDirectoryGraph()` context-aware
- Added cancellation checks in progress reporting
- Implemented graceful shutdown for worker goroutines

## Testing Verification

### Test Results
Before fix:
```
4. Testing stop sync...
Stop response: {"success":true}
2025/07/10 20:46:27 ðŸ“Š Building Graph [0.0%] 0/1 dirs | Files: 0 (0.0/s)
2025/07/10 20:46:29 ðŸ“Š Building Graph [0.0%] 0/1 dirs | Files: 1 (0.5/s)
```

After fix:
```
4. Testing stop sync...
Stop response: {"success":true}
6. Testing terminal output after stop...
If you see sync logs in terminal after this point, there's still a bug.
Stopping GUI...
Test completed!
```

### Verification Steps
1. Start GUI with `./sftp-sync-gui --gui`
2. Click "Start Sync" in web interface
3. Observe logs appearing in GUI only
4. Click "Stop" button
5. Verify no additional logs appear in terminal
6. Confirm sync process is properly cleaned up

## Performance Impact

- **Memory**: Slightly reduced due to elimination of pipe goroutines
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead from context checking
- **Responsiveness**: Improved stop responsiveness (cancellation within 1-2 seconds)

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Rapid start/stop cycles**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
2. **Network connection failures**: Error suppression after cancellation
3. **Large file transfers**: Context checking during transfers
4. **Multiple concurrent operations**: Proper synchronization with mutexes

## Future Improvements

1. **Timeout configuration**: Make cancellation timeout configurable
2. **Graceful transfer completion**: Allow current file transfer to complete before cancelling
3. **Progress preservation**: Maintain progress information across start/stop cycles
4. **Connection pooling**: Reuse SFTP connections for better performance

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed pipe-based log redirection complexity
- Eliminated goroutine leaks
- Improved error handling and cleanup
- Added proper context cancellation support
- Enhanced process lifecycle management

This fix ensures that the GUI properly manages log output redirection and provides a clean user experience with no log leakage to the terminal after stopping sync operations.
